The business page provides a snapshot of all important information. The messaging feature gives users and businesses a direct line of communication for any additional inquiries. User's are also able to leave reviews for businesses they've used or like other reviews that are helpful.<br><br>Business owners are able to create a business page with all of their relevant information to attract new customers. On the dashboard, they will see an overview of their business's recent reviews and messages.</div><h1 class="emphasis">my role</h1><div class="beta">As the lead front-end developer, my role in developing AnimalFax included building out the user interface and interactive features from provided designs. The designs are beautiful and have given me great insights into design patterns and their intersection with development which have helped me immensely. There were even opportunities to implement my own designs on the settings and search pages, which are highlighted later.<br><br>This was also the first project where I used Angular, so there was a great experience involving learning the ins an outs and best patterns for getting the most out of this powerful framework. Grunt was another new addition that I'm absolutely crazy about because it allows me to spend less time on development and deployment chores and more time creating awesome.</div><h1 class="emphasis">pages</h1><div class="beta">Let's take a brief look at some of the major pages within AnimalFAX.</div><h2 class="emphasis">landing page</h2><div class="beta"><figure><img class="screenshot" src="/assets/img/animalfax_landing_page.jpg" alt="Screenshot of AnimalFAX landing page on desktop"></figure><br>The landing page consists of two main components. The top section is the hero image, which contains an overlay of the main heading and basic search bar. Additionally, there is a browse dropdown that gives users quick access to businesses through the major categories. The bottom section shows an overview of the six most recently added businesses, their rating, address, and categories.</div><h2 class="emphasis">dashboard</h2><div class="beta"><figure><img class="screenshot" src="/assets/img/animalfax_dashboard.jpg" alt="Screenshot of AnimalFAX Dashboard page on desktop"></figure><br>Upon logging in, business owners are directed to their dashboard where they can see an overview of recent activity relating to their business, including reviews and messages. From here, there are links for easy access to edit the business information, view the profile as a user would, flag any questionable reviews, and see all messages. Also, notice that when on any page aside from the landing page, the search bar moves into the header for easy access regardless of the page.</div><h2 class="emphasis">business profile</h2><div class="beta"><figure><img class="screenshot" src="/assets/img/animalfax_business_profile.jpg" alt="Screenshot of AnimalFAX Business Profile page on desktop"></figure><br>The business profile is what a user will see upon clicking on a business from the landing page or search results. It is the central location for all business information including description, photos, reviews, categories, location, and additional information. Users are also able to send messages to the business owner for any inquiries.</div><h2 class="emphasis">settings</h2><div class="beta"><figure><img class="screenshot" src="/assets/img/animalfax_settings.jpg" alt="Screenshot of AnimalFAX Settings page on desktop"></figure><br>On the settings page, the main concerns are separated into the tabs, edit profile, change password, and business profile. In this manner, for users that aren't also business owners they will only see the first two tabs. All the information displayed on the user and business profiles is selected here.</div><h2 class="emphasis">search</h2><div class="beta"><figure><img class="screenshot" src="/assets/img/animalfax_search.jpg" alt="Screenshot of AnimalFAX Search page on desktop"></figure><br>My favorite page, the search page is where users can browse AnimalFAX's businesses with extensive filtering options. On desktop devices, the filter controls are displayed on the left with the search results populating on the right. I love the UI that I created for the filters. With so much data being displayed and processed, there is a potential for it to become overly complex and cluttered, but I believe I succeeded in creating a beautiful, straight-forward, and most importantly functional filtering system.</div><h1 class="emphasis">workflow</h1><div class="beta">Prior to AnimalFAX, I was working with applications built using Node and Express which was comfortable and familiar, but also messy and unstructured. When I began to learn Angular, it was immediately apparent how much value there is in creating SPAs using Angular as opposed to the previous Node and Express stack. Always striving for continued improvement, I also took the initiative to implement Grunt into my development workflow and it has consistently enabled me to increase development efficiency.</div><h2 class="emphasis">angular</h2><div class="beta">The description from the introduction in Angular's Developer Guide, "Angular is what HTML would have been, had it been designed for applications", becomes more valid the longer I use it. Additionally, its definition as a structural framework is poignant, and one of my favorite reasons for recommending Angular.<br><br>I think Angular and JavaScript share some of the same qualities which make for a complimentary environment. The framework is flexible enough to allow me to do what I need to do without getting in the way, but structured enough to provide good constructs for organization and reinforcement of maintainable, scalable code.<br><br><figure><img class="screenshot" src="/assets/img/angular_example_1.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Angular Search Module for this AnimalFAX"><figcaption class="epsilon">Module for the Search Page of AnimalFAX</figcaption></figure><br>Angular's pattern for creating modules is a fantastic way of structuring an application. It makes for a clean, easy to navigate file structure as well as encapsulation within the code. I can easily see everything I need to know about the search page in two files, <em>search.js</em> and <em>search.html</em>.<br><br>On line 3, I define the module "search_view" along with any dependencies to be injected; in this case, "ngRoute" is the only dependency. Beginning on line 5 is the search module's config block, where "routeProvider" is injected as a dependency and used to define the route. It references search.html as the view template and "SearchViewController" as the view controller, which begins on line 14.<br><br>Of course, this is a relatively simple example, and even without adding functionality the code could be structured completely different. Thus, while Angular provides the tools necessary to build a well-structured, extensible application, it becomes highly important to enforce design standards that define said structure. At the time of writing this, I've been diving into <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide">John Papa's Angular Styleguide</a> to educate myself of best practices moving forward.</div><h2 class="emphasis">grunt</h2><div class="beta">DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is a common development principle and part of the foundation I've used to consistently improve. In this context, it was the impetus that lead me to find Grunt, The JavaScript Task Runner. While DRY is typically thought of in terms of actual code being written, I saw the enormous opportunity to streamline my workflow by automating as many of the set up and optimization tasks that happen repeatedly with any project. In doing so, I've effectively created more time that can be spent developing fun things and solving complex problems rather than being a glorified data-processor.<br><br><figure><img class="screenshot" src="/assets/img/grunt.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Gruntfile for this website"><figcaption class="epsilon">End of Gruntfile for this website</figcaption></figure><br>With AnimalFAX being my first introduction to Grunt, I only made use of the less, connect, and watch modules. For the purposes of a better demonstration, the screenshot is from this website and illustrates how much further it is possible to automate tasks.<br><br>The lines most important to focus on are 136 and 142, which are the main tasks I use to accomplish practically everything for development and production - just two tasks!<br><br>The default task is what runs when you type the 'grunt' command in the terminal. What this means is that I'm able to begin development by just typing a single word. Amazing! In the second argument, the array contains the names of the subtasks that will be run when the default command is issues; these are bowercopy, connect, and watch. First, bowercopy will ensure that all external assets I've registered in my bower.json file are available and then copy them into my development assets folder as I've specified. Once that is confirmed, connect will spin up a local server instance and watch will then continuously run and update html, css, and js files upon being changed. It's also important to note that because I use LESS, the watch task will technically watch for changes in the less files and then run the less task which minifys and compiles them to css.<br><br>Once development completes a milestone and is ready to update production, the task on like 142 is run simple, with the 'grunt prod' command. Again, bowercopy is run initially, but this time with its 'prod' subtask that will update assets in the production folder. Copy simply copies the css, img, and fonts assets folders from development to production. Uglify will minify and concatenate all of the JavaScript into a single file and htmlmin does as is self-described, minifying the html files. Lastly, compress will iterate through the html, css, and js assets in the production folder and create gzipped copies for maximum optimization.<br><br>While this is just a glimpse into the power of Grunt, it represents a huge improvement over the days of compiling less manually or even worse, writing pure css. There's no question in my mind, Grunt is the unsung hero for web developers and one of my most valued tools.</div><h1 class="emphasis">conclusion</h1><div class="beta">AnimalFAX marks a great milestone in my development career. With a great concept and designs in place, I was able to fully devote myself to learning Angular as well as greatly improving my workflow with Grunt. Learning from my experience with Spur, I also began to implement better design patterns in my Less development that have built the base for a custom framework that I have continued to improve and use to this day.</div></div></div>
