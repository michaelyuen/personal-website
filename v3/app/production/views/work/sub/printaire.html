With SDK's in the most popular languages, developers can easily integrate the service into existing applications without extensive refactoring. What's more, once implemented PrintAire effectively replaces the need for any overhead from maintaining in-house infrastructure.</div><h1 class="emphasis">my role</h1><div class="beta">The roles for this project were clearly defined. My coworker built PrintAire's REST API while I took the role of Lead Front-end Developer and implemented everything else.<br><br>As for the design, the majority of the static supporting pages retained the general style from the original theme. The exception are the dynamic pages; dashboard, orders, order details, settings, and documentation. On these pages, I did the design work with a focus on optimizing the content's presentation.<br><br>Overall, I am quite happy with the result. While there are some things that I feel could be improved had the development been done from scratch, PrintAire is still a clean, user-friendly application that performs well and provides all the information a user may need.</div><h1 class="emphasis">good - bad - ugly</h1><div class="beta"><figure><div class="browser"><div class="top"><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul><span><i class="fa fa-globe"></i> bogdanpreda.com/themes</span><div class="hamburger"><span></span> <span></span> <span></span></div></div><img class="screenshot" src="/assets/img/printaire_origin.jpg" alt="Screenshot of original theme on desktop device"></div><figcaption class="epsilon">Bogdan's Marketing Theme - the origin of PrintAire</figcaption></figure><br>An interesting challenge came from the genesis of PrintAire, where my bosses decided that we would build on top of <a target="_blank" href="http://bogdanpreda.com/themes/tf-marketing/v1/">the marketing theme from Bogdan.</a> While the intentions were good, to expedite the development, and some of the static content was reusable, unfortunately I feel that in this case it was a choice that caused more work than it replaced.<br><br>One of the bad things about using themes is that they tend to be poorly optimized, and this was no exception. The JavaScript folder alone is 1.7 mb! Being performance minded, this was both unacceptable and unnecessary for a custom web app. Also, since my current development stack leverages the amazing AngularJS, I knew I would be able to replicate everything while trimming the fat of all the excess JavaScript.<br><br>The theme looks great in a vacuum. That is, if it were being used as ideally intended with the content simply being replaced, it would continue to look nice. However, as soon as you begin removing large chunks and customizing it loses the shine. Furthermore, since the majority of the pages are user only, that means there must be a separation from the single page design. Thus, in order to provide a consistent experience throughout the site, I made the decision that this would be best presented through individual pages, further uglying up the development process.<br><br>As a result, PrintAire is a far cry from the original theme, but what is presented is a much better cohesive package.</div><h1 class="emphasis">dashboard</h1><div class="beta responsive">The biggest challenge in creating PrintAire's dashboard was to organize and present the data in a logical, visually straightforward way. In this case, the design is only considered to be successful if it serves as a function of enhancing the user experience.<br><br><figure><div class="browser"><div class="top"><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul><span><i class="fa fa-globe"></i> printaire.com/#/dashboard</span><div class="hamburger"><span></span> <span></span> <span></span></div></div><img class="screenshot" src="/assets/img/printaire_dashboard_desktop.jpg" alt="Screenshot of PrintAire Dashboard page on desktop device"></div></figure><br>Working with a feature that is data-focused can be problematic due to the natural clutter that comes with the more data being presented. In my case, I enjoy the challenge because there is a wealth of opportunity to improve the experience.<br><br>Structuring the order data in a card format is a great way to develop a visual and logical heirarchy of information. At a glance, it is now trivial to differentiate between the two major categories - pending and submitted. Within each column, the primary order information is placed into another card with the secondary information (order number and date) being placed at the beginning of each overall order. The primary information card is additionally given a header with the selected product and a body with the other pertinent information - quantity, price, and status.<br><br><div class="phone"><div class="top"><div class="camera"></div><div class="speaker"></div></div><img class="screenshot" src="/assets/img/printaire_dashboard_phone.jpg" alt="Screenshot of PrintAire Dashboard page on mobile device"><div class="bottom"><div class="home"></div></div></div>Another great benefit of the card format is consistency across devices. As is evident, the only significant change in the design is the shift of the pending and submitted order columns being stacked.<br><br>Otherwise, everything is exactly the same, which means a user can use PrintAire with confidence knowing that the experience and interections will be identical regardless of the chosen platform. This is especially important given the prevalence of users accessing websites through their phones.</div><h1 class="emphasis" style="clear: both">docs</h1><div class="beta">By far, my favorite page to build for PrintAire was the documentation! The same challenge presented on the dashboard takes place here, but to an even greater extent. There's a lot of important information to display, and doing so in an orderly way is of the utmost importance. After all, with PrintAire being a service targeting developers, having good documentation is critical.<br><br><figure><div class="browser"><div class="top"><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul><span><i class="fa fa-globe"></i> printaire.com/#/docs</span><div class="hamburger"><span></span> <span></span> <span></span></div></div><img class="screenshot" src="/assets/img/printaire_docs.jpg" alt="Gif of Logoji Labs Login page material design on desktop device"></div></figure><br>The design for the documentation page was inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#intro">Stripe's documentation.</a> That being said, their exact implementation remains a mystery which gave me a great opportunity to rebuild and tweak the design, and it was a blast.<br><br>One notable difference is that with Stripe the documentation page opens in a new tab, whereas I felt it was a more desirable experience to keep it contained within the site as a whole. When the user scrolls and the header exits the viewport, the documentation container will stick to the top and cover the entire page. If the user returns to the top, the header will reappear as one would expect. This creates a more cohesive experience since the user isn't forced to jump between tabs.<br><br>Using Bootstrap, creating the columns containing the information and associated code examples was trivial. However, by default they don't exactly behave the way I wanted in this case. The default styling will create columns that have heights according to their content, but I wanted both columns to be coordinated with the same height determined by the column with more content.<br><br>The solution I used was actually rather simple - tables! The rows containing the columns are styled as tables and the columns are styled as table cells. Voila! Each section's information and code examples have the same height regardless of the content.<br><br><figure><div class="browser"><div class="top"><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul><span><i class="fa fa-globe"></i> printaire.com/#/docs</span><div class="hamburger"><span></span> <span></span> <span></span></div></div><img class="screenshot" src="/assets/img/printaire_docs2.jpg" alt="Screenshot of PrintAire Documentation page on desktop device"></div></figure><br>The last cool feature I want to highlight is the menu highlighting. While the implementation isn't the most complex, I love this feature because I think it really enhances the user experience. One of the most overlooked aspects of many websites is the navigation, and how simple styling cues make a big difference. I always place a lot of focus on any menus I build, ensuring they are clear and easy to understand at a glance. PrintAire's documentation menu embodies this focus.<br><br>As the screenshot above demonstrates, the menu item coordinating with the active section is clearly highlighted. If a section has sub-sections then the menu item will expand and highlight its child appropriately. What's more, as the user scrolls the menu highlighting is updated dynamically. Using the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oblador/angular-scroll">Angular Scrollspy</a> directive, an active class is added to the appropriate menu item and from there the styling is simple.</div><h1 class="emphasis">conclusion</h1><div class="beta">PrintAire was a great project to build out. While the overall scope wasn't as large as some of the other projects, this allowed me to take a more focused approach and really analyze my process. Additionally, it was great to be exposed to challenges such as customizing a theme and creating a detailed documentation page. As beneficial as research and reading is for learning, there's no substitue for trial by fire and I know the next time I encounter similar requirements I'll be able to devour them like a piece of cake.</div></div></div>
