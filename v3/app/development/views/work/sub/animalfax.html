The messaging feature gives users and businesses a direct line of communication for any additional inquiries. User's are also able to leave reviews for businesses they've used or like other reviews that are helpful.
			<br><br>
			Business owners are able to create a business page with all of their relevant information to attract new customers. On the dashboard, they will see an overview of their business's recent reviews and messages.

		<h1 class="emphasis">my role</h1>

		<div class="beta">
			As the lead front-end developer, my role in developing AnimalFax included building out the user interface and interactive features from provided designs. This was also the first project where I used Angular, so there was a great experience involving learning the ins an outs and best patterns for getting the most out of this powerful framework. While my Angular development has been naturally refined in more recent projects, it was immediately apparent how much value there is in creating SPAs using Angular as opposed to our previous Node and Express stack. Always striving for continued improvement, I also took the initiative to implement Grunt into my development workflow and it has been consistently delivering increased efficiency.
