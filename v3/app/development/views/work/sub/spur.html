		<div class="beta">
			SPUR is a dynamic service that brings buyers and sellers together in real-time to make convenient, location-based transactions. While websites such as Craigslist provide digital classifieds to buy and sell, the process of arranging a meeting is an undeniable headache. SPUR aims to flip the script with a unique platform that gives buyers the ability to make on-demand purchases with ease by finding mobile sellers in their area ready to immediately deliver.
			<br><br>
			The map view integrates the Google Maps API, letting buyers dynamically see where active sellers are located around them. Additionally, buyers can focus their interest using the powerful search feature with various filters such as category, subcategory, distance, and keywords. For sellers, this view will give them a visual sense of where their customers are located as well as allow them to sort by the transaction status.
			<br><br>
			Conversely, there is a list view that some users prefer, giving priority to business information and goods and services available, as opposed to perceived distance on a map.
			<br><br>
			The open spurs page gives buyers and sellers an overview of all their open transactions, their current status, and utilities for communicating, canceling, and leaving reviews.
			<br><br>
			In addition, there are numerous supporting pages such as a buyer profile, listing profile, manage listings, becoming a seller, spur history, and settings. For the sake of brevity, I won't be discussing them in detail; a novella would be the result.
