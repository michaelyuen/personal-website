		<div class="beta">
			SPUR is a dynamic service that brings buyers and sellers together in real-time to make convenient, location-based transactions. While websites such as Craigslist provide classifieds to buy and sell, the process of arranging a meeting is an undeniable headache. SPUR aims to flip the script with a unique platform that gives buyers the ability to make on-demand purchases with ease by finding mobile sellers in their area ready to immediately deliver.
			<br><br>
			The map view integrates the Google Maps API, letting buyers dynamically see where active sellers are located around them. Additionally, buyers can focus their interest using the powerful search feature with various filters such as category, subcategory, distance, and keywords. For sellers, this view will give them a visual sense of where their customers are located as well as allow them to sort by the transaction status.
			<br><br>
			Conversely, there is a list view that some users may prefer, giving priority to business information and goods and services available, as opposed to perceived distance on a map.
			<br><br>
			The open spurs page gives buyers and sellers an overview of all their open transactions, their current status, and utilities for communicating, canceling, and leaving reviews.
			<br><br>
			In addition, there are numerous supporting pages such as a buyer profile, listing profile, manage listings, becoming a seller, spur history, and settings. For the sake of brevity, I won't be discussing them in detail; a novella would be the result.

		<h1 class="emphasis">my role</h1>

		<div class="beta">
			During my internship I was tasked with a variety of supporting tasks throughout Bold Technologies suite of products. Along with the timing of stepping into a full time position happened to come the contract for the development of SPUR. Thus, a great challenge and opportunity presented itself; SPUR would be the first project I would take substantial development responsibility to produce a robust, user-facing application.

			<br><br>

			Our team consisted of myself, a dedicated designer, another developer, and a QA specialist. Additionally, there was a SPUR native app being produced with its own developers. After a brief discussion, I assumed the responsibility of the lead front-end developer with the other developer taking charge of the core business logic. I was extremely excited to take that role, as the front-end environment has always appealed to me even when I had limited experience. And of course, I viewed it as a great opportunity to demonstrate my value since an application's UI can be fundamental in success.

			<br><br>

			In more technical terms, I produced working interfaces from the designs provided as well as collaborated with the designer to make compromises where I saw concerns. This was my introduction to Bootstrap and Less, and was a trial-by-fire in creating well-constructed markup and styling. Also, the majority of the views required a substantial amount of application logic using node.js and express.js which I developed as well. In hindsight, the amount of work would have been better distributed among more than one developer, but I was happy and proud to have so much ownership over the product. I can browse through SPUR and see my direct impact in everything, and that's what I love about front end.

			The core of SPUR is the live map, which features all the magic for buyers to browse listings on the map in real time. For sellers, it will also provide visual context for the proximity of buyers that have requested their service. There is also an alternative list view, where the listings are displayed with more emphasis on the buyer and their product or service; that won't be highlighted here.

				<div class="bottom">
					<div class="home"></div>
				</div>
			</div>

			The live map consists of two main components - the map and the filter. First, is the actual map, powered by the Google Maps API, that displays markers for all sellers in the visible area. The markers have custom icons that coordinate with the categories and are color coded according to availability. The most awesome feature is that they are real-time, tracking along the roads as the seller travels. This means that buyers can make purchasing decisions based on convenience, empowered by the knowledge that the seller is nearby; and once a seller is requested they can watch the map and know exactly when they will arrive.

			<br><br>

			The filter gives users the power to tailor the listings shown in the map to be exactly what they want. There are five main categories to choose from, as well as numerous subcategories that will autopopulate. Still too many? The distance selection will create a radius down to a minimum of 5 miles to increase the specificity. Also, there is the alternative to type in a keyword to only show listings containing the key. Perhaps the buyer will be travelling soon and is interested in what is offered in that area? Using the location search will center the map around the given address or city and show the listings in that area.

					<div class="home"></div>
				</div>
			</div>

			On mobile, the filter is implemented as a drawer to account for the limited screen real estate. The category slider is visible at all times because it is given the highest priority. It can be used without needing to open the drawer and will update automatically. If the buyer desires more exact results, the drawer can be seamlessly slid up using the tab to reveal the full filtering options. Aside from a logical reordering, the drawer is practically identical to the sidebar on the desktop view.

		<h1 class="emphasis">conclusion</h1>

		<div class="beta">
			SPUR's development was a rollercoaster to put it politely. With the benefit of perspective through time, I can definitely say that it was a project that would test any developer's resolve. If I wasn't certain that development was for me, SPUR would have made me reconsider my career.

			<br><br>

			However, since this is my passion I didn't see things that way initially. There were a lot of issues, and unfortunately with my lack of experience I didn't know if I could trust my intuition against the words of people that had many years in the industry. Now, I can optimistically be grateful with the project behind me, having the experience to recognize and avoid the same mistakes in the future. While it's not something I wish for, there's no question that learning from mistakes is extremely effective.

			<br><br>

			That being said, there is <strong>so</strong> much I have learned since SPUR that reviewing the code now is quite painful. But again, I'm grateful because this project was the first step along the path towards what I have learned and continue to learn. Throughout development, I could feel that I was repeating myself a lot and working inefficiently, but it was only going through that process that led me to research and find tools like Grunt or better patterns for Less architecture. And perhaps the bottom line is that despite being fully aware that I had much to learn, I developed an awesome product. There is always something to learn and improve, but that shouldn't be something to be used as an excuse for not getting the job done.
