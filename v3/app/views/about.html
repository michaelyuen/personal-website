            Hello! My name is <strong>Michael</strong>, and I'm a web developer specializing in web apps built with <a target="_blank" href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://parse.com/">Parse</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://lesscss.org/">LessCSS</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.

            I <strong>love</strong> tinkering with bits of code, and thanks to my <a target="_blank" href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> workflow, I get to spend more time doing it! While I've always been a full stack developer, I believe my abilities are really highlighted in the front-end environment.

            Graduating from the University of Central Florida with a Bachelor's in IT, I hit the ground running with a foundation of knowledge and a thirst for learning. Since then, I've been busy making <strong>kick ass</strong> web apps for <a target="_blank" href="http://boldtech.co/">BOLD! Technologies</a>.

            One of my <strong>proudest</strong> achievements is the change I've made through a serious commitment to fitness. What began as a simple desire to build muscle has developed into an active lifestyle that has improved my life in countless ways and translated well into a love of the outdoors - especially hiking and kayaking!

            Additionally, I also practice <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jkdinstitute.com/">Jeet Kune Do</a>, which has quickly become one of my favorite activities. There is nothing quite like the unique ability martial arts and fighting has to make you feel both empowered and humbled.

            Another gigantic passion of mine is <strong>animals</strong>. I'm not yet ready to commit to being a dog owner, but by volunteering at <a target="_blank" href="http://petallianceorlando.org/">Pet Alliance of Greater Orlando</a> it allows me to help them and also get my fix for belly rubs and slobber. Here I am with my friend Zeus; with a smile like that it's no wonder he was adopted that day!

            Lastly, I'm a brand new aquarist and simply <strong>obsessed</strong> with the hobby! I recently finished setting up and cycling my 10 gallon planted tank and stocked it with 3 Dwarf Puffers, Puff Daddy, BB, and Grunt, and 1 Clown Pleco named Salty Sam. Sunny, a Golden Apple Snail, was a recent addition to the family along with a Nerite Snail and a dozen Ghost Shrimp. They make for an <strong>amazing</strong> cleaning crew and are really fascinating to watch! If ever I'm reported missing, be sure to check that I'm not just staring into the aquarium mesermized.
