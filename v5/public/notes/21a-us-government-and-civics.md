## Foundations of American Democracy



### The Social Contract

> Do we even need government? Why do we need government?



#### Without it

- unlimited rights
- no laws
  - freeset possible speech, religion, property, movement (go anywhere)
  - tax/take from others
  - just settle on others' land
  - punish/imprison others

#### Problems

Someone else can infringe on your rights. You can infringe on theirs.



> As long as men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in the condition known as 'war'; and it is a war of every man against every man.

- Thomas Hobbes, *Leviathan*, 1861



... in war the two chief virtues are force and fraud

... no such thing as ownership. no distinction between mine and thine.

... every man has a right to everything - even to someone else's body

This was written around the time after British civil war when there was a lot of chaos.

Hobbes was an advocate of a very strong central government.



**Social Contract**. willingness to give up some rights in order to keep others.

"should be contented with as much liberty against other men as he would allow other men against himself"



#### Still a big question

What form should the government take?





## Democratic Ideas of US Government

Notion of natural rights.

Life, liberty, and property - John Locke



what about others?

- physical harm on others
- imprison others
- Tax others



Let's give these rights to the government in order to protect the others.



Ok, so what type should it be?

Throughout history... monarchy.

Or a small group - oligarchy.

Other extreme where the people are sovereign - popular sovereignty (democracy)



Founding fathers were concerned with pure democracy because factions could form and then a majority faction could strip natural rights from others.

Thus...

### Limited Government

(this can exist in other governments besides democracy)

- constitution

- checks and balances

- bill of rights

  

### Notion of Republic

founding fathers liked to call US a republic.

to some - any gov not a monarchy

to others - democracy, but still protect rights of minorities

founding fathers - something to prevent passions of pure democracy. Representatives. logistically more practical.



#### Federalist Papers

Alexander Hamilton has idea to publish a series of papers.

Writes most. Recruits James Madison and John Jay.

Federalist Papers #10 (most famous) - James Madison discusses how to avoid factions taking over the government and doing things that are not in the interest of the people.

Small quote:

> The two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic are: first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of citizens and a greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be extended.





## Democratic Ideals in the Declaration of Independence

US Constitution replaces Articles of Confederation



life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness - natural rights

"Among these" -- implies there may be more?

... it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institude new government
