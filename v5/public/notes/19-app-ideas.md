## TIL App



### Idea :bulb:

A platform enabling anyone to easily keep a TIL journal. That may be all they use it as, and that's cool.

Further, use technology to reinforce these learnings. My reaction is to algorithmically encourage users to revisit their learnings using the spaced repetition technique. Certainly further research is warranted.



#### Does this already exist?

Idk, I should look around.



### Background

I created a new page on my website titled **Today I Learned**. This is by no means an original concept, but that's not important. Unashamed, I started it with an ulterior motive, to be a vehicle to committing at least once a day. If I can follow through with this, the benefits will actually be twofold; aside from the vanity of having Github contributions I may better solidify things I am actually learning!



### Aside

Another idea that has been bouncing around my mind is building a blogging platform. 

> But there are already so many!

Yeah, yeah, I know and agree. And yet I want to, because what I have in mind is a little different. It's catered to my desires, which I didn't find in any existing product. I also think it would fill a niche that other people would be interested in as well. Lastly, what kind of engineer would I be if I didn't assess other solutions and think "but I could build that!" In fact, it's built already (though very rudimentary); I'm using it to write this now!



### Assumptions

1. The general blogging framework is built. Even "blogging" may be too specific because it should really enable people to create content in whatever manner they choose.

2. A specialized implementation that can extend upon #1.

   

   That is, #1 can and should be a standalone product, but #2 is built upon the foundation. Perhaps a plugin system such that #1 can be extended to support various special use cases besides #2. Too soon to really know.

## Rotten Real Estate



### Idea :bulb:

Rotten Tomatoes, but for real estate. Also, Rate My Professor, but for real estate.



### Problem Statement

Various interactions in the real estate category **suck**, and technology can empower improving this.

- Better transparency for tenants

- Hold landlords accountable
  - and other roles
  - supers
  - Agents / brokers
- Information about potential neighbors
  - i.e., the home/apartment is nice but actually living there is a nightmare due to other circumstances
- Collect info from other sources and centralize in a more easily navigable and digestible format
  - historical issues
  - crime
  - Pests



### Background

I was reading the Wikipedia page about the film **Ford v Ferrari**, and the section about critical reception referred to Rotten Tomatoes. Rotten Tomatoes is such an interesting concept to me. I don't truly know, so this may be wrong, but I think *anyone* can submit reviews for films and tv shows.

Rate My Professor is definitely another website with a similar concept, at least in a general sense.
