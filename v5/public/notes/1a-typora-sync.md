# Typora Sync

I just set up syncing for Typora. It doesn't come out of the box like other apps, so I had to set it up myself. In the end, I chose iCloud.



Initially, I had some thoughts around how to concoct a solution myself, but I think choosing a service is good for a few reasons. For one, the time I would have spent creating a half-baked solution can now be spent on something else. Going off that same point, it is good to keep in line with my typical rationale that it is better to utilize a product (in this case iCloud) that has already had a ton invested in it to be good and do its job.



I also thought to use DropBox and discovered they have no free options. And briefly, thought to use Google Drive because it's more familiar to me than iCloud, which I have typically avoided. However, I want to avoid using Google's products as much as possible due to their privacy practices and so I sucked it up and figured out how to get set up with iCloud. It was actually quite simple.



The only issue I forsee is if I were to run out of storage space. :man_shrugging:
