      <p>TIL that identical twins can't be of different sexes.</p>
      <p>Sue's sister is pregnant with twins, and somehow the subject arose. I feel pretty dumb because I reacted "<b>for sure</b> identical twins can be boy and girl!" Well, I was totally wrong and hopefully this learning will stick with me.</p>
      <p><b>Bonus fun fact:</b> Apparently semi-identical twins are a thing!</p>
