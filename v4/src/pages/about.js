      <p>
        Hello! My name is <strong>Michael</strong>, and I'm a software engineer with a passion for front-end development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in web apps built with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and particularly enjoy promoting good practices in unit testing them with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html">Karma</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a>. Additionally, some of my current areas of interest include <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/michaelyuen/ngWordpress">ngWordpress</a>, profiling application memory performance, and Angular 2 + Typescript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Graduating from the University of Central Florida with a Bachelor's in IT, I hit the ground running with a foundation of knowledge and a thirst for learning. Since then, I've been working professionally as a web developer. Currently I'm on the Consumer UI Team with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://accesso.com/">accesso</a> working on the Passport eCommerce Platform.
